# NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The Risk Management Framework offers a method for incorporating risk management tasks for security, privacy, and the cyber supply chain into the life cycle of system development. The risk-based approach to selecting and specifying controls takes into account the efficacy, efficiency, and limitations imposed by any applicable laws, orders, executive orders, policies, standards, or regulations. Effective information security and privacy programs are imperative to managing organizational risk. The RMF approach can be used with all systems, any kind of technology (such as IoT, control systems), and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.

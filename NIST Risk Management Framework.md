# NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The Risk Management Framework offers a method for incorporating risk management tasks for security, privacy, and the cyber supply chain into the life cycle of system development. The risk-based approach to selecting and specifying controls takes into account the efficacy, efficiency, and limitations imposed by any applicable laws, orders, executive orders, policies, standards, or regulations. Effective information security and privacy programs are imperative to managing organizational risk. The RMF approach can be used with all systems, any kind of technology (such as IoT, control systems), and within any type of organization regardless of size or sector.

<b>Steps Inlcude:</b>
## Prepare 
Carry out essential activities to help prepare all levels of the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the RMF.

## Categorize 
Categorize the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on an impact analysis.

## Select 
Select, tailor, and document the controls necessary to keep the organization and system safe in accordance with risk.

## Implement 
Implement the controls in the security and privacy plans for the system and organization.

## Assess 
Assess to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect
to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the organization.

## Authorize
Provide  accountability by requiring a senior official to determine if the security and privacy risk based on the operation of a system or the use of common controls, is acceptable to run/operate.

## Monitor
Continously monitor and maintain ongoing situational awareness about the security and privacy posture of the system and organization to support risk management decisions.
